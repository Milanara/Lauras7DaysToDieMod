Information: 
Changes: 
To traders: 
 - Expanded Trader Hours of Operation
 - Expanded Trader book inventory, particularly for Rekt (because he's near my character, but you can easily adapt to whichever trader you want, just find the number in "steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Data\Config\traders.xml")
 - Expanded Raw resources inventory, particularly gunpowder and other necessities. 
 
To Items: 
 - Increased stack sizes for ammo, food, and a lot of low stack items 
 - Increase auger block damage and range 
 
To Recipes 
 - Added a recipe for solar cells, locked by electronics skill tree
 - Adapted the concrete/cement recipe to produce more... I'm building a castle. Enjoy it or remove it as you please. 
 
To Progression
 - Expanded the electrician levels up to 125 and added solar panels up to tier 6 (well, 6 hasn't been tested yet, but it should work based off of previous alphas)
 
To Localization
 - Added the english version for Electrician tier 5 copied over from electrician 4 because I'm lazy. Feel free to adapt for other languages if you wish.
